I miss walking in Hobart. And I miss the [Hobart Library](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/locations/hobart-library/). Walk in, sit down, connect to the wifi, and concentrate on something with a magnificent view of Mt Wellington off to the side. No registration, no handing over your passport, no depositing your bag, no passwords, plenty of natural light, plenty of places to sit, but plenty of other people around to provide atmosphere. 

But it's not all bad news in Bangkok. I'm hoping to write some notes here about my favourite places to sit and work or study. Top of the my list at the moment is where I'm sitting now: Tim Horton's at Samyan Mitrtown.
