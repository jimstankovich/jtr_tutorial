I miss walking in Hobart. And I miss the [Hobart Library](https://libraries.tas.gov.au/locations/hobart-library/). Walk in, sit down, connect to the wifi, and concentrate on something with a magnificent view of Mt Wellington out the window. No registration, no depositing your bag, no handing over your passport, no passwords, plenty of natural light, plenty of places to sit, but enough atmosphere with other people in the library as well. 

I've tried sitting in a few libraries

- Siam Society Library
- Bangkok City Library 
- Library in Central World
- Thammasat University Library

but none of them do it for me. The Nonthaburi City Library is better: you can just walk in and sit there. However, it doesn't have air-conditioning, wifi, or many power-points, so I don't think it's a long-term option.

I've tried a few co-working spaces:
- Samyan Co-op (free): very crowded, hard to find a seat at the times I
- True co-working space Asoke 
- one in Silom (quiet, dark)

So I've lowered my standards ...
