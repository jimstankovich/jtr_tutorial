## Statistics

- [MSNI stats tips](https://msni-stats-tips.netlify.app/)

- [Biostatistics Blog](https://blogs.utas.edu.au/biostatistics/). I worked on this blog many years ago with some former colleagues in Hobart. Several of them currently teach a course [Introduction to Biostatistics](https://www.utas.edu.au/courses/chm/units/cam625-introduction-to-biostatistics) at the University of Tasmania.

- [Statistics, Data, Science](https://m-clark.github.io/): Michael Clark's website, particularly his very insightful notes on [mixed models](https://m-clark.github.io/mixed-models-with-R/).


## Quarto

I couldn't have made this website without

- the notes [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/) written by Jenny Bryan and others, and

- the [template](https://github.com/jtr13/website-template) made by Joyce Robbins, along with her [video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN75YXaLFGM).
I have to follow this video every time I update the website.  :)
