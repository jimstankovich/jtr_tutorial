I'm planning to put some notes on statistics and R here.

I moved to Bangkok, Thailand in February 2024. Before that I worked as a statistician in Australia. You can see some details in [my ORCID record](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9344-7749).

Here's another page I maintain with some attempts to translate Thai into English. I'm currently enjoying Thai lessons at the [Sumaa Language and Culture Institute](https://www.sumaa.net/).
