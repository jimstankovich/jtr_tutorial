Bang Pho is the name of an intersection and a train station near where I live. According to [this dictionary](http://sealang.net/thai/), *bang* (บาง, pronounced "barng") means "locality along a waterway" (like the "Bang" in Bangkok), and *pho* (โพ, pronounced like the start of "poem") is a bo/bodhi tree/pipal tree, a type of fig tree ([*ficus religiosa*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficus_religiosa)). 

These pronunciations assume an Australian accent.  :)
